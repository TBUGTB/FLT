# A "module topology" for a module over a topological ring.

Let `A` denote a topological ring.

If `M` is an `A`-module, then we can let `M` inherit a topology from `A`, namely
the finest topology which makes all the `A`-linear maps `A →ₗ[A] M` continuous.

## Constructions on modules.

This module-topology may or may not have the following cool properties:

1) Any `A`-linear map `φ : M →ₗ[A] N` is continuous.
2) The `A`-module topology on `Unit` is the topology already present on `Unit`.
3) The `A`-module topology on `A` is `A`s original topology.
4) The `A`-module topology on a product `M × N` of two modules-with-module-topology is
   the product topology.
5) The `A`-module topology on a power `M^n`, that is, `n → M` with `n : Type`, is the
(now possibly infinite) product topology.

6) Now say `A` is commutative. Then the tensor product of two `A`-modules is an `A`-module,
and so we can ask if the canonical bilinear map from `M × N` (with the module or product topology?
probably they're the same) to `M ⊗[A] N` is continuous.

7) Commutativity of `A` also gives spaces of `A`-linear maps the structure of `A`-modules,
so we can ask for example whether the function application map `M × (M →ₗ[A] N) → N` is continuous.

8) We could also ask whether the evaluation map, from `M →ₗ[A] N` to the power space `N^M` of bare
functions from `M` (now considered only as an index set, so with no topology) to `N` is continuous.
